## Why create this project?
Since I started coding acout 5 years ago, I've always wanted to build some of the software that I use daily, and a web browser is one of them. I have finally have the technical knowledge to accomplish this goal (even if the solution is a bit hacky). This project is like a "checkpoint" in my programming journey.

## Why is it called Opus?
An opus refers to any artistic work, especially one on a large scale - that describes the goal of this project perfectly.

**NOTE**: This project os very experimental and is not intended for daily use. Please **DO NOT** input any sensitive information into the browser.
